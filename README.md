Exploring Persona Vectors

## Thursday, January 8, 2026

Gonna create a .bloom environment to just focus on bloom and what it offers. 

Gah. Bit the bullet and signed up for a full year of Claude.

I am going to be using Gemini and Claude to direct my deep dive into [Persona Vectors](https://www.anthropic.com/research/persona-vectors). This paper makes use of two open-source models, Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

Nice! [Here](https://github.com/safety-research/persona_vectors) is a repo on this very subject! I came across this after seeing the article [Introducing Bloom: an open source tool for automated behavioral evaluations](https://www.anthropic.com/research/bloom) on the Anthropic Research page. Both repos were created by [Safety Research](https://github.com/safety-research)

I get the read that Bloom evolved out of Persona Vectors, suggesting maybe this is where I need to start. 

Both Gemini and Claude thinks Bloom is a better place to start, so yeah, gonna pivot to this.
