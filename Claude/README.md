This folder will contain all of the code generated and managed by [Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/ae9db331-fff1-43ca-89ee-0e927d4b1cc1)

I had to add a few more libraries to the environment before I was able to run the initial code sample's PersonaVectors_TechnicalImplementation.py and PersonaVectors_HuggingFaceTransformers.py

1. uv pip install matplotlib
2. uv pip install scikit-learn
3. uv pip install transformers
